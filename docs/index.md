# PhlyGreen

PhlyGreen is an open-source platform for aircraft designed, focused on novel propulsion architectures,
supporting hybrid-electric, all-electric, and conventional configurations. 
The code is under development at Sapienza Universita' di Roma. 

This guide explains the logic, workflow, and structure of each major subsystem in the codebase.

This documentation includes:

- **User Guide** – learn how to run and customize missions and designs 
- **Developer Guide** – understand the architecture and modify modules  
- **API Reference** – automatically generated from Python docstrings  

> This manual is designed to help both students and researchers understand how
> PhlyGreen works internally and how to extend it for new propulsion concepts.

PhlyGreen has been created by Riccardo Malpica Galassi and Matteo Blandino (Sapienza University of Rome). The project has also benefited from contributions by Aeronautical Engineering Master’s students, including João Delille and Valeria Falcone, as part of their thesis research.
